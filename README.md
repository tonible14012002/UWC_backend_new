# UWC_backend_new
# Setup MySQL
Take scripts in the "MySQL Scripts" folder of the repo and run in MySQL workbench/MySQL Shell to create a db, according to the following order:
```
Schema.sql
Procedure.sql
Trigger.sql
Insert.sql
```
# Setup OSRM
Download Docker.  
Download OpenStreetMap extracts for Vietnam from Geofabrik:
```bash
wget https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/vietnam-latest.osm.pbf
```
## Pre-process the extract with the car profile and start a routing engine HTTP server on port 5000
Store the file within a local directory "${PWD}" self defined.
```bash
docker run -t -v "${PWD}:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-extract -p /opt/car.lua /data/vietnam-latest.osm.pbf
```
The flag -v "${PWD}:/data" creates the directory /data inside the docker container and makes the current working directory "${PWD}" available there. The file /data/vietnam-latest.osm.pbf inside the container is referring to "${PWD}/vietnam-latest.osm.pbf" on the host. The run may take a wild amount of time and possibly return error. Then:
```bash
docker run -t -v "${PWD}:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-partition /data/vietnam-latest.osrm
docker run -t -v "${PWD}:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-customize /data/vietnam-latest.osrm
```
Note that vietnam-latest.osrm has a different file extension.
```bash
docker run -t -i -p 5000:5000 -v "${PWD}:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-routed --algorithm mld /data/vietnam-latest.osrm
```
Make requests against the HTTP server to test:
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/route/v1/driving/13.388860,52.517037;13.385983,52.496891?steps=true"
```
# Setup environment
Clone project from github.  
Config manually the DATABASE_CREDENTIALS section in the uwc_backend/settings.py. Change the password to fit your MySQL account. 
```python
DATABASE_CREDENTIALS = {
    'user':'root',
    'password':'${YOUR_PASSWORD}',
    'host':'127.0.0.1',
    'database': 'uwc_2.0'
}
```
## create virtual environment 
Create new virtualenvironment inside project folder and activate it.
```bash
virtualenv env
.\env\scripts\activate
```
Install all dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now try to run the local server
```bash
python manage.py runserver 
```
